Creating a movie clone website involves building a site that replicates the functionality and<br>
design of a popular movie streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. This will include features like displaying a list of movies, a search function, and perhaps even user authentication.<br>

Here's a breakdown of how you can achieve this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:<br>

1. Structure with HTML<br>
Start by structuring your website with HTML. This includes creating elements for the header, movie grid, search bar, and footer.<br>

2. Styling with CSS<br>
Next, style your website with CSS to make it visually appealing.<br>

3. Interactivity with JavaScript<br>
Finally, add interactivity with JavaScript. This will include fetching movie data and dynamically inserting movie items into the HTML.<br>
